## August 3, 2025

### 🧠 AI Tools Used

* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

### 🎯 Purpose of AI Assistance

AI tools were leveraged to assist in building, refining, and troubleshooting both frontend and backend features of the full-stack User Management System. Specific areas of involvement included:

#### 🔧 Frontend (React)

* Guided the cleanup of the following components:

  * `Login`, `Home`, `Header`, `Users`, `GetUserById`, and `SearchByName`
* Assisted in:

  * Managing form state transitions (e.g., toggling user update form).
  * Designing feedback mechanisms (e.g., inline success/error messages instead of popups).
  * Triggering conditional UI actions post-login, post-update, and post-delete.

#### 🐍 Backend (Flask)

* Helped:

  * Identify and resolve SQLite-related errors (e.g., missing tables).
  * Clarify RESTful endpoint design.
  * Fix CORS and response handling issues during integration with React.
  * Test and debug API endpoints using automated test cases.

---

### ✍️ Modifications Made

* Customized UI logic to:

  * Show/hide forms based on user interactions.
* Refined routing and navigation logic to improve UX (e.g., redirecting on successful login/delete).
* **Rejected AI suggestions** for cookie-based token storage in favor of simpler, client-side `localStorage` implementation.
* Reworked update/delete logic to:

  * Avoid premature form resets.
  * Preserve and reuse existing user input where necessary.

### ✅ Summary

AI assistance helped speed up development, especially around common patterns and architectural decisions. All generated suggestions were **reviewed, tested, and adapted** to match the specific project context and coding standards.
