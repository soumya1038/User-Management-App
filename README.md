Welcome to the retain coding challenge. This assignment consists of two independent tasks designed to evaluate your skills in both refactoring existing code and building a new feature from scratch. You are expected to complete both tasks within the time.


Task 1: Code Refactoring Challenge
________________


Overview
You've inherited a legacy user management API that works but has significant issues. Your task is to refactor and improve this codebase while maintaining its functionality.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+ installed
Tech Stack
This is an open-ended challenge. You can use any tech stack you choose. The original application is built with Python, but feel free to migrate to a different language or framework if you think it's a better architectural decision. 


Some common options include:
* Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend:  Node, REST APIs, Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pandas
* Data & Infra: PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker
Setup (Should take < 5 minutes)
Access the codebase via this Drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VkL8uMy60faAgKdiI4nxe5UTUaQCSXbe/view?usp=sharing
# Clone/download this repository
# Navigate to the assignment directory
cd messy-migration


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Initialize the database
python init_db.py


# Start the application
python app.py


# The API will be available at http://localhost:5000


Testing the Application
The application provides these endpoints:
* GET / - Health check
* GET /users - Get all users
* GET /user/<id> - Get specific user
* POST /users - Create new user
* PUT /user/<id> - Update user
* DELETE /user/<id> - Delete user
* GET /search?name=<name> - Search users by name
* POST /login - User login
Refactor this codebase to improve its quality, security, and maintainability. The application currently works but has numerous issues that need addressing.
What We're Looking For
1. Code Organization (25%)
   * Proper separation of concerns
   * Clear project structure
   * Meaningful function/variable names
2. Security Improvements (25%)
   * Identify and fix security vulnerabilities
   * Implement proper data validation
   * Secure sensitive information
3. Best Practices (25%)
   * Error handling
   * Proper HTTP status codes
   * Code reusability
4. Documentation (25%)
   * Clear explanation of changes made
   * Justification for architectural decisions
   * Any trade-offs you made
What to Focus On
* Identify the most critical issues first
* Make the code production-ready
* Ensure the API remains functional
* Write at least a few tests for critical functionality
What NOT to Do
* Don't add new features or endpoints
* Don't spend time on UI/frontend
* Don't over-engineer the solution
* Don't aim for 100% test coverage
* Don't create extensive documentation beyond explaining your changes
Submission
Deliverables
1. Your refactored code
2. A CHANGES.md file documenting:
   * Major issues you identified
   * Changes you made and why
   * Any assumptions or trade-offs
   * What you would do with more time
How to Submit
1. Create a new git repository with your solution
2. Include all necessary files to run the application
3. Ensure python app.py still works after setup
4. Share the repository link
Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate your submission based on:
* The quality of your solutions.
* The identification of critical issues.
* The readability and organization of your code.
* Your pragmatic decision-making.
* The clarity of your communication.
AI Usage Policy
You are permitted to use AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) as you would any other tool. If you use AI significantly, please make a note in your CHANGES.md file, including:
* Which tools you used.
* What you used them for.
* Any AI-generated code you modified or rejected.


Questions?
If you have questions about the requirements, please email anand@retainsure.com within the first 30 minutes of starting the challenge.
Remember: We are not looking for perfection. We want to see how you approach real-world coding problems, prioritize improvements, and communicate your decisions effectively. Good luck!

Task 2: URL Shortener Service
________________


Overview
Build a simple URL shortening service similar to bit.ly or tinyurl. This assignment tests your ability to design and implement a small but complete feature from scratch.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+ installed
Setup (Should take < 5 minutes)
# Clone/download this repository
# Navigate to the assignment directory
cd url-shortener


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Start the application
python -m flask --app app.main run


# The API will be available at http://localhost:5000
# Run tests with: pytest



What's Provided
* Basic Flask application structure
* Health check endpoints
* One example test
* Empty files for your implementation
Your Task
Build a URL shortener service with the following features:
Core Requirements
1. Shorten URL Endpoint
   * POST /api/shorten
   * Accept a long URL in the request body
   * Return a short code (e.g., "abc123")
   * Store the mapping for later retrieval
2. Redirect Endpoint
   * GET /<short_code>
   * Redirect to the original URL
   * Return 404 if short code doesn't exist
   * Track each redirect (increment click count)
3. Analytics Endpoint
   * GET /api/stats/<short_code>
   * Return click count for the short code
   * Return creation timestamp
   * Return the original URL
Technical Requirements
* URLs must be validated before shortening
* Short codes should be 6 characters (alphanumeric)
* Handle concurrent requests properly
* Include basic error handling
* Write at least 5 tests covering core functionality
Example API Usage
# Shorten a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/shorten \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url"}'


# Response: {"short_code": "abc123", "short_url": "http://localhost:5000/abc123"}


# Use the short URL (this redirects)
curl -L http://localhost:5000/abc123


# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:5000/api/stats/abc123


# Response: {"url": "https://www.example.com/very/long/url", "clicks": 5, "created_at": "2024-01-01T10:00:00"}
